# Project on clustering world countries by their vulnerability and readiness to climate disruptions

Context

Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues to address for countries around the world. With more and more climate disasters happening: heat waves, floods, storms etc, how are countries positioned to address them? How can they know if and how they are vulnerable? How can they know if they are ready to address their vulnerability by investing in long term solutions?

Research question: How can we group the countries of the world based on their vulnerability to climate disruptions and readiness to leverage private and public sector investment for adaptive actions?

This clustering analysis can help countries around the world understand where they stand and guide them through necessary policy changes.
